## Atmospheric and climate modelling Virtual Research Community (VRC) 

*Led by the University of Oslo, norway*

### Overview of the research community


### Typical day of a researcher


### Walk through Nature Geoscience paper “Equilibrium climate sensitivity above 5 °C plausible due to state-dependent cloud feedback” - Jenny Bjordal,  Trude Storelvmo, Kari Alterskjær & Tim Carlsen 


#### (research/investigation) with demoes:

- Data used: how was the data accessed (e.g., what repositories or locations). 
- Software used: which software, give demo
- Method used: workflows? scripts? where are they?
- Results: where results were deposited? 
- Collaboration: how was the collaboration during this process?
- Challenges
- Vision of EOSC for the community

###  Case studies (WP7)

#### Multidisciplinary use case
- studies on 2020 lockdown

#### Vertical use cases introduction

- Grand Challenge 1: Sea pollution - case study 1
- Grand Challenge 2: Loss of Biodiversity and Sustainability (Biodiversity, fisheries, marine litter) – case study 2
- Grand Challenge 3: Extreme weather events and climate adaptation (biomass) – case study 3
- Grand Challenge 4: Reducing the consequences of large volcanic eruptions – case study 4 and 5
